## Overview

OpenClaw Manager is a visual management tool that helps you quickly install, configure, and manage OpenClaw instances. No manual config editing required — just 3 steps to deploy.

Two messaging channels are supported:

| | Telegram | Feishu (Lark) |
|---|---|---|
| Connection | Bot API (long polling) | WebSocket persistent connection |
| Credentials needed | Bot Token + your User ID | App ID + App Secret |
| Platform setup | Create a Bot only | Create an app + enable WebSocket subscription |
| User auth | Bound by User ID — only authorized users can chat | Any user who can message the Bot can chat |
| Best for | Personal use, international users | Team collaboration, users in China |

## Prerequisites

### Common

- **Node.js 22+**: The script installs OpenClaw via npm if not present, so Node.js is required
- **EvoLink API Key**: Sign up at [evolink.ai](https://evolink.ai/dashboard) and get your API Key

    4. Under "App Capabilities > Bot", enable the bot capability and set the bot name

    ![Enable bot](/images/OpenClaw-Feishu/enable-bot.png)

    <Warning>
    Feishu app basic setup is now complete. The remaining steps — event subscription and version release — must be done after the gateway is deployed and running, otherwise the long connection settings will fail to save. Complete Step 1 and Step 2 below first, then return to Feishu Open Platform to continue.
    </Warning>

## Step 1: Download & Run

Download the executable for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/open-claw/openclaw-manager/releases):

![GitHub Releases page](/images/OpenClaw-Auto/github-releases.png)

![Download executable](/images/OpenClaw-Auto/github-repo.png)

| Platform | File |
|----------|------|
| Windows | `openclaw-manager-win-x64.exe` |
| macOS (Intel) | `openclaw-manager-macos-x64` |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `openclaw-manager-macos-arm64` |
| Linux | `openclaw-manager-linux-x64` |

<Warning>
Make sure [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) is installed.
</Warning>

Windows users right-click and run as administrator. macOS / Linux users run with `sudo` in terminal:

```bash
chmod +x ./openclaw-manager && sudo ./openclaw-manager
```

The script will check for and install OpenClaw if needed, then start the local web management interface and open your browser.

## Step 2: Create an Instance

### 2.1 — Basic Info

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Instance Name | Name for your instance (e.g. `mybot`), must be unique on this machine |
| Model | Choose a model: Haiku 4.5 / Sonnet 4.5 / Opus 4.5 / Opus 4.6 |
| Channel | Choose a channel: Telegram or Feishu |

![Basic info](/images/OpenClaw-Auto/wizard-step1-basic-info.png)

### 2.2 — Credentials & Deploy

All channels require an **EvoLink API Key**.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Telegram">
    Enter the **Bot Token** from @BotFather, then click **Deploy**.

    The script will automatically:
    1. Create the OpenClaw config file
    2. Write model and API Key settings
    3. Configure and enable the Telegram plugin
    4. Install and start the gateway service

    ![Telegram credentials](/images/OpenClaw-Auto/wizard-step2-telegram-credentials.png)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Feishu">
    Enter the **App ID** and **App Secret** from Feishu Open Platform, then click **Deploy**.

    The script will automatically:
    1. Create the OpenClaw config file
    2. Write model and API Key settings
    3. Configure the Feishu plugin (write App ID / App Secret) and enable it
    4. Install and start the gateway service

    ![Feishu credentials](/images/OpenClaw-Auto/wizard-step2-credentials.png)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Wait for the progress bar to complete, then you'll advance to the next step automatically.

### 2.3 — Connect

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Telegram">
    Enter your **Telegram User ID** (the numeric ID from @userinfobot), then click **Connect**.

    The script writes this ID to the `allowedUsers` config — only this user will be able to chat with the Bot. Once connected, you'll be redirected to the home page.

    ![Telegram connect](/images/OpenClaw-Auto/wizard-step3-telegram-connect.png)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Feishu">
    Deployment is complete. Now return to Feishu Open Platform to configure event subscription.

    <Warning>
    Before configuring event subscription, make sure the following are done:
    - Feishu channel configuration is complete (see Step 2 deployment)
    - Gateway is running (check with `openclaw gateway status`)
    </Warning>

    On the **Event Subscription** page:

    1. Select **Use long connection to receive events** (WebSocket mode)
    2. Add event: `im.message.receive_v1` (receive messages)

    <Warning>
    If the gateway is not started or the channel has not been added, the long connection settings will fail to save.
    </Warning>

    ![Event subscription](/images/OpenClaw-Feishu/event-subscription.avif)

    3. Under "Version Management & Release", create a version and submit for review

    <Note>
    Feishu apps require admin approval before they can be used. Enterprise custom apps are usually approved automatically.
    </Note>

    Click **Done** — the script will restart the gateway to establish the Feishu WebSocket connection. After redirecting to the home page, you can start messaging the Bot on Feishu.

    ![Feishu connect](/images/OpenClaw-Auto/wizard-step3-feishu-connect.png)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Manage Instances

After deployment, the home page displays all instances:

![Instance management](/images/OpenClaw-Auto/home-instance-running.png)

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🟢 Green | Gateway running |
| 🔴 Red | Gateway stopped |

Each instance card shows the model and channel in use. Available actions:

- **Start / Stop**: Start or stop the gateway service
- **Delete**: Remove the instance (stops the gateway and cleans up all config files)

Click **+ New Instance** to create multiple instances, each running independently on a different port.
