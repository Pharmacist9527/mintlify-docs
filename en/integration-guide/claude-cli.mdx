## Overview

![Claude CLI Interface](/images/integration-guide/image-9.png)

Claude CLI is the official command-line tool from Anthropic for interacting with Claude models in the terminal.
By integrating Claude CLI with **EvoLink API**, you can directly access Claude model capabilities through EvoLink.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring, make sure you have:

### 1. Install Node.js and npm

**Why needed?** Node.js is the runtime environment for CLI tools (like an OS for apps).

**If already installed:** Run `node -v` and `npm -v` to check version. If v20+, skip this step.

**First-time installation:**
- Download and install from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) (recommend LTS version)
- If you're unfamiliar with the installation process, refer to [Runoob - Node.js Installation Guide](https://www.runoob.com/nodejs/nodejs-install-setup.html)
- Recommended: **Node.js v20 or higher**
- Verify installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### 2. Get EvoLink API Key

- Log in to [EvoLink Dashboard](https://evolink.ai/dashboard)
- Find API Keys in the dashboard, click "Create New Key" button, then copy the generated Key
- API Key usually starts with `sk-`

## How to Open Terminal

## Step 1: Install Claude CLI

### 1. Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**Expected result:** Download info scrolling, ending with `added XX packages` (takes 1-3 minutes).

**If error occurs:** `permission denied` means Windows needs "Run as administrator" PowerShell, macOS/Linux add `sudo` before command.

### 2. Verify Installation

```bash
claude --version
```

**Success indicator:** Shows version number (e.g., `1.x.x`).

    ### 2. Edit settings.json

    In the opened folder, if `settings.json` doesn't exist, right-click in empty space → New → Text Document → Rename to `settings.json` (remove `.txt` extension). Then double-click to open with an editor and add the following content:

    ```json
    {
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-evolink-api-key",
        "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.evolink.ai",
        "CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC": "1"
      },
      "permissions": {
        "allow": [],
        "deny": []
      }
    }
    ```

    **⚠️ Important:**
    - **Copy completely** without missing any symbols
    - Replace `"your-evolink-api-key"` with actual API Key (keep quotes)
    - Don't use Chinese input method for punctuation

    **Configuration options:**
    - `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your EvoLink API Key
    - `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: EvoLink API endpoint
    - `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC`: Reduce non-essential network requests

Yes, fully supported. Claude CLI supports Chinese input and output—you can ask questions in Chinese and receive Chinese responses.

### 7. No output after execution—what could be the cause?
Common causes include:
- Network connection issues preventing API server access
- Invalid API Key or insufficient balance
- Incorrect `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` configuration
- Firewall or proxy blocking requests

### 8. Why don't my config file or environment variable changes take effect?
- Restart your terminal or command line window
- Check that `settings.json` has valid JSON syntax
- Verify the config file path:
  - Windows: `C:\Users\{username}\.claude\settings.json`
  - macOS / Linux: `~/.claude/settings.json`

## Notes

<Warning>
Run Claude CLI in a dedicated project folder. Avoid running it in sensitive directories (such as system folders or directories containing credentials). Claude CLI operates starting from the current working directory.
</Warning>

<Tip>
If you previously logged in with an official account, clear the `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable or override it in `settings.json`.
