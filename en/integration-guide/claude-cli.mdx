## Overview

![Claude CLI Interface](/images/integration-guide/image-9.png)

Claude CLI is the official command-line tool from Anthropic for interacting with Claude models in the terminal.
By integrating Claude CLI with **EvoLink API**, you can directly access Claude model capabilities through EvoLink.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring, make sure you have:

### 1. Get EvoLink API Key

- Log in to [EvoLink Dashboard](https://evolink.ai/dashboard)
- Find API Keys in the dashboard, click "Create New Key" button, then copy the generated Key
- API Key usually starts with `sk-`

## How to Open Terminal

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    - Method 1: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd` or `powershell`, then press Enter
    - Method 2: Search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell" in the Start menu
    - Method 3: Hold Shift and right-click in a folder, select "Open PowerShell window here"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    - Method 1: Press `Command + Space` to open Spotlight, type `Terminal`, then press Enter
    - Method 2: Go to "Applications" → "Utilities" → "Terminal"
    - Note: macOS uses zsh by default (macOS 10.15+), older versions use bash, both work fine
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    - Method 1: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` shortcut
    - Method 2: Search for "Terminal" in the application menu
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 1: Install Claude CLI

### 1. One-Command Installation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
    ```

    **Expected result:** You'll see download and installation info, ending with a success message.

    **If error occurs:** `permission denied` means you need to add `sudo` before the command.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    Run in PowerShell:
    ```powershell
    irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
    ```

    **Expected result:** You'll see download and installation info, ending with a success message.

    **If error occurs:** You need to "Run as administrator" PowerShell.

    **After installation, you need to configure environment variables:**

    After installation, the CLI will be placed at: `C:\Users\<your-username>\.local\bin\claude.exe`

    **Why configure PATH?**
    Windows can only find executable programs in directories specified in PATH. If you don't add this directory to PATH, you'll need to use the full path to run claude.exe.

    **Permanent configuration (Recommended):**
    1. Open **System Settings** → **System** → **About** → **Advanced system settings**
    2. Click **Environment Variables**
    3. Find **Path** in "User variables", click **Edit**
    4. Click **New**, add the following path (note: it's the directory, not the exe file):
       ```
       C:\Users\<your-username>\.local\bin
       ```
    5. Click **OK** to save
    6. **Restart your terminal** (close and reopen PowerShell or CMD)

    **Quick configuration (Temporary):**
    If you don't want to modify system settings, you can temporarily add it in the current PowerShell session:
    ```powershell
    $env:PATH += ";$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin"
    ```
    Note: This method only works for the current session and will be lost after closing the terminal.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Note:** This installation method doesn't require pre-installing Node.js or npm. The installation script handles all dependencies automatically.

### 2. Verify Installation

```bash
claude --version
```

**Success indicator:** Shows version number (e.g., `1.x.x`).

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    ### 2. Edit settings.json

    In the opened folder, if `settings.json` doesn't exist, right-click in empty space → New → Text Document → Rename to `settings.json` (remove `.txt` extension). Then double-click to open with an editor and add the following content:

    ```json
    {
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-evolink-api-key",
        "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.evolink.ai",
        "CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC": "1"
      },
      "permissions": {
        "allow": [],
        "deny": []
      }
    }
    ```

    **⚠️ Important:**
    - **Copy completely** without missing any symbols
    - Replace `"your-evolink-api-key"` with actual API Key (keep quotes)
    - Don't use Chinese input method for punctuation

    **Configuration options:**
    - `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your EvoLink API Key
    - `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: EvoLink API endpoint
    - `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC`: Reduce non-essential network requests
