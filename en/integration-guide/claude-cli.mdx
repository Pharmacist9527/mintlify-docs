## Overview

![Claude CLI Interface](/images/integration-guide/image-9.png)

Claude CLI is the official command-line tool from Anthropic for interacting with Claude models in the terminal.
By integrating Claude CLI with **EvoLink API**, you can directly access Claude model capabilities through EvoLink.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring, make sure you have:

### 1. Install Node.js and npm

- Download and install from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/)
- If you're unfamiliar with the installation process, refer to [Runoob - Node.js Installation Guide](https://www.runoob.com/nodejs/nodejs-install-setup.html)
- Recommended: **Node.js v20 or higher**
- Verify installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### 2. Get EvoLink API Key

- Log in to [EvoLink Dashboard](https://evolink.ai/dashboard)
- Create and copy your API Key
- API Key usually starts with `sk-`

  <Tab title="Method 1: GUI Operation">
    ### 1. Open config directory

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Windows">
        Press `Win + R`, paste the following, then press Enter:
        ```
        %userprofile%\.claude
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="macOS">
        In Finder, press `Command + Shift + G`, paste the following path, then press Enter:
        ```
        ~/.claude
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Linux">
        Open file manager and navigate to:
        ```
        ~/.claude
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    ### 2. Edit settings.json

    In the opened folder, find or create `settings.json` file, double-click to open with an editor, and add the following content:

    ```json
    {
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-evolink-api-key",
        "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.evolink.ai",
        "CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC": "1"
      },
      "permissions": {
        "allow": [],
        "deny": []
      }
    }
    ```

    **Configuration options:**
    - `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your EvoLink API Key
    - `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: EvoLink API endpoint
    - `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC`: Reduce non-essential network requests
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Method 2: One-Command Creation">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Windows PowerShell">
        ```powershell
@"
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-evolink-api-key",
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.evolink.ai",
    "CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC": "1"
  },
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [],
    "deny": []
  }
}
"@ | Out-File -FilePath "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\settings.json" -Encoding utf8
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
        ```bash
cat > ~/.claude/settings.json << 'EOF'
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-evolink-api-key",
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.evolink.ai",
    "CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC": "1"
  },
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [],
    "deny": []
  }
}
EOF
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    After running the command, remember to replace `your-evolink-api-key` with your actual API Key.

## FAQ

### 1. What is Claude CLI and what is it used for?
Claude CLI is the official command-line tool from Anthropic that allows users to interact with Claude models in the terminal. It's primarily used for code assistance, text generation, Q&A conversations, and file analysis—especially suited for developers who need quick AI capabilities in a command-line environment.

### 2. How do I verify installation and configuration on first use?
Run these commands in sequence:
- `node -v` and `npm -v`: Confirm Node.js and npm are installed
- `claude --version`: Confirm Claude CLI is installed
- `claude "Who are you"`: Confirm API configuration is correct

### 3. What's the difference between interactive mode and single command mode?
- **Interactive mode**: Run `claude` to enter continuous conversation for multi-turn interactions, ideal for complex tasks
- **Single command mode**: Run `claude "question"` to get a single response and exit, ideal for quick queries

### 4. Will Claude CLI automatically read or upload my local files and code?
No. Claude CLI only reads file content when you explicitly reference or authorize it, and will request confirmation before performing sensitive operations. It's recommended to use it in a dedicated project folder.

### 5. How do I use Claude CLI to analyze or process local file content?
In interactive mode, you can reference files by:
- Typing the file path for Claude to read
- Dragging files into the terminal window
- Copy and pasting file content

### 6. Does Claude CLI support Chinese input and output?
Yes, fully supported. Claude CLI supports Chinese input and output—you can ask questions in Chinese and receive Chinese responses.

### 7. No output after execution—what could be the cause?
Common causes include:
- Network connection issues preventing API server access
- Invalid API Key or insufficient balance
- Incorrect `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` configuration
- Firewall or proxy blocking requests

### 8. Why don't my config file or environment variable changes take effect?
- Restart your terminal or command line window
- Check that `settings.json` has valid JSON syntax
- Verify the config file path:
  - Windows: `C:\Users\{username}\.claude\settings.json`
  - macOS / Linux: `~/.claude/settings.json`

### 9. What causes 401/403 errors?
- **401 error**: `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` not set or invalid API Key
- **403 error**: Insufficient API Key permissions or expired key
- Verify `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is set to `https://api.evolink.ai`

### 10. What scenarios is Claude CLI suited for? What is it not suited for?
**Suited for:**
- Code writing, debugging, and refactoring
- Quick Q&A in command-line environments
- File content analysis and processing
- Automation script integration

**Not suited for:**
- Complex interactions requiring a graphical interface
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Large-scale batch file processing

### 11. How do I switch models?
Type `/model` in interactive mode to switch models.

### 12. How do I upload images?
- Option 1: Reference the image path
- Option 2: Drag and drop an image into the terminal
- Option 3: Paste an image directly

All methods require user action—Claude CLI will not automatically read or upload local images.

## Notes

<Warning>
Run Claude CLI in a dedicated project folder. Avoid running it in sensitive directories (such as system folders or directories containing credentials). Claude CLI operates starting from the current working directory.
</Warning>

<Tip>
If you previously logged in with an official account, clear the `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable or override it in `settings.json`.
