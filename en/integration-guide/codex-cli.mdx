## Overview

![Codex CLI Interface](/images/integration-guide/image-6.png)

Codex CLI is OpenAI's official command-line tool for code-related tasks in the terminal. Compared to general chat tools, it emphasizes engineering-ready output with clearer, actionable code changes.
By integrating Codex CLI with **EvoLink API**, you can access EvoLink's models (such as **GPT series**) through a unified OpenAI-compatible interface with one key and one base URL.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring, make sure you have:

### 1. Install Node.js and npm

- Download and install from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/)
- If you're unfamiliar with the installation process, refer to [Runoob - Node.js Installation Guide](https://www.runoob.com/nodejs/nodejs-install-setup.html)
- Recommended: **Node.js v18 or higher**
- Verify installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### 2. Get EvoLink API Key

- Log in to [EvoLink Dashboard](https://evolink.ai/dashboard)
- Create and copy your API Key
- API Key usually starts with `sk-`

## Step 1: Install Codex CLI

### 1. Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

### 2. Verify Installation

```bash
codex --version
```

## Step 2: Configure EvoLink API

Codex CLI supports a custom Provider via config file, no source code modification needed.

### 1. Find Config File

Config file location:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```
    C:\Users\{username}\.codex\config.toml
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
    ```
    ~/.codex/config.toml
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Edit Config File

Edit `config.toml` with the following content:

```toml
model = "gpt-5.2"
model_reasoning_effort = "medium"
model_provider = "evolink"

[model_providers.evolink]
name = "EvoLink API"
base_url = "https://api.evolink.ai/v1"
env_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
wire_api = "responses"
```

Config fields:
- `model`: default model name
- `model_reasoning_effort`: reasoning depth (adjust as needed)
- `model_provider`: provider name that matches the section below
- `base_url`: EvoLink API endpoint
- `env_key`: environment variable name for the API key
- `wire_api`: must be `responses`

### 3. Configure API Key

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Windows PowerShell">
    **Temporary (current session only)**
    ```powershell
    $env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-evolink-api-key"
    ```

    **Permanent**
    ```powershell
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("OPENAI_API_KEY", "your-evolink-api-key", "User")
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
    **Temporary (current session only)**
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-evolink-api-key"
    ```

    **Permanent**
    Edit `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, add:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-evolink-api-key"
    ```
    Then run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` to apply.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 4. Supported Models

| Model Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `gpt-5.1` | GPT 5.1 |
| `gpt-5.2` | GPT 5.2 |

## Step 3: Start Using Codex CLI

### 1. Enter working directory

```shell
cd <your-working-directory>
```

### 2. Interactive mode

```shell
codex
```

### 3. Single query mode

```shell
codex "Who are you"
```

If you receive a normal response, the configuration is successful.

## FAQ

### 1. What is Codex CLI and what is it used for?
Codex CLI is OpenAI's official command-line tool focused on code-related tasks. It emphasizes engineering-ready output with clearer, actionable code changes.

### 2. How do I verify installation and configuration on first use?
Run these commands in sequence:
- `node -v` and `npm -v`: Confirm Node.js and npm are installed
- `codex --version`: Confirm Codex CLI is installed
- `codex "Who are you"`: Confirm API configuration is correct

### 3. What's the difference between interactive mode and single command mode?
- **Interactive mode**: Run `codex` to enter continuous conversation for multi-turn interactions
- **Single command mode**: Run `codex "question"` to get a single response and exit

### 4. Will Codex CLI automatically read or upload my local files and code?
No. Codex CLI only reads file content when you explicitly reference or authorize it. It's recommended to use it in a dedicated project folder.

### 5. How do I use Codex CLI to analyze local file content?
In interactive mode, you can reference files by:
- Typing the file path for Codex to read
- Dragging files into the terminal window
- Copy and pasting file content

### 6. Does Codex CLI support Chinese input and output?
Yes, fully supported.

### 7. No output after execution—what could be the cause?
Common causes include:
- Network connection issues
- Invalid API Key or insufficient balance
- Incorrect `base_url` configuration
- Firewall or proxy blocking requests

### 8. Why don't my config changes take effect?
- Restart your terminal
- Check `config.toml` syntax (TOML format)
- Verify config file path:
  - Windows: `C:\Users\{username}\.codex\config.toml`
  - macOS / Linux: `~/.codex/config.toml`

### 9. What causes 401/403 errors?
- **401 error**: `OPENAI_API_KEY` not set or invalid
- **403 error**: Insufficient permissions or expired key
- Check that `env_key` matches your environment variable name

### 10. What scenarios is Codex CLI suited for?
**Suited for:**
- Code writing, debugging, and refactoring
- Quick Q&A in command-line environments
- File content analysis

**Not suited for:**
- Complex GUI interactions
- Real-time collaborative editing

### 11. How do I switch models?
Edit the `model` field in `config.toml`.

### 12. How do I upload images?
- Option 1: Reference the image path
- Option 2: Drag and drop an image into the terminal
- Option 3: Paste an image directly

All methods require user action—Codex CLI will not automatically read or upload local images.

## Notes

<Warning>
Run Codex CLI in a dedicated project folder. Avoid running it in sensitive directories (such as system folders or directories containing credentials). Codex CLI operates starting from the current working directory.
</Warning>

<Tip>
The `wire_api` in config must be set to `"responses"`. `"chat"` is deprecated.
